`keiro` also supports a `middleware.ts` file which is called before each route, to define a middleware:

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Code 
lang="ts" 
title="src/routes/middleware.ts" 
code={`
import { defineMiddleware } from "keiro";

export default defineMiddleware((event, next) => {
    return next(event);
});
`}  
/>
