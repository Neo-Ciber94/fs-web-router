title: Configuring Worker Threads
description: Using worker threads
---

For enable multi-threading you can use `fileSystemRouter({ workers: true })` which creates
a thread pool up to the number of available logical processors or use specify the number of workers using `fileSystemRouter({ workerCount: 4 })`.

```ts
// src/main.ts
import { fileSystemRouter } from "keiro/node";
import http from "node:http";

http
  .createServer(
    fileSystemRouter({
      workers: { workerCount: 4 },
    }),
  )
  .listen(3000);
```

## How it works?

Internally we use node [Worker](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) API, and create a pool of workers. When a request comes we take an available worker and serialize the request
and send it to the worker and then deserialize the response of the worker and send it as a response.

Each worker have its own router which is used to handle the request.

<Aside type="caution" title="Workers are isolated!">
 Workers cannot directly share data between each other, you cannot share global state,
 so each request should be handle independently.
</Aside>

## Is not multi-threading always faster?

No. 

We recommend profiling your app before enabling workers, unless you are handling a big number of request
you may not see any difference when enabling workers, it may be even slighly inneficient to using workers
for a few number of request per second.
